       All options can be abbreviated to a unique leading prefix.

       An explicit file name of ``-'' represents standard input; it is assumed
       if no input files are specified.

       On VAX VMS and IBM PC DOS, the leading ``-'' on option names may be re-
       placed by a slash, ``/''; however, the ``-'' option  prefix  is  always
       recognized.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mbibclean 22mprettyprints input BibTeX files to 4mstdout24m, or to a user-speci-
       fied file, and checks the brace balance and bibliography  entry  syntax
       as  well.  It can be used to detect problems in BibTeX files that some-
       times confuse even BibTeX itself, and importantly, can be used to  nor-
       malize the appearance of collections of BibTeX files.

       Here is a summary of the formatting actions:

       o  BibTeX  items  are  formatted  into  a consistent structure with one
          4mfield24m 4m=24m 4m"value"24m pair per line, and the initial @ and trailing  right
          brace in column 1.

       o  Tabs  are  expanded into blank strings; their use is discouraged be-
          cause they inhibit portability, and can suffer corruption  in  elec-
          tronic mail.

       o  Long  string values are split at a blank and continued onto the next
          line with leading indentation.

       o  A single blank line separates adjacent bibliography entries.

       o  Text outside BibTeX entries is passed through verbatim.

       o  Outer parentheses around entries are converted to braces.

       o  Personal names in 4mauthor24m and 4meditor24m field values are  normalized  to
          the  form  ``P.  D.  Q.   Bach'',  from  ``P.D.Q. Bach'' and ``Bach,
          P.D.Q.''.

       o  Hyphen sequences in page numbers are converted to en-dashes.

       o  Month values are converted to standard BibTeX string abbreviations.

       o  In titles, sequences of upper-case characters at  brace  level  zero
          are  braced  to protect them from being converted to lower-case let-
          ters by some bibliography styles.

       o  CODEN, ISBN (International Standard Book Number) and ISSN  (Interna-
          tional  Standard  Serial Number) entry values are examined to verify
          the checksums of each listed number, and correct ISBN hyphenation is
          automatically supplied.

       The standardized format of the output of 1mbibclean 22mfacilitates the later
       application of simple filters, such as 1mbibcheck22m(1),  1mbibdup22m(1),  1mbibex-0m
       1mtract22m(1),  1mbibindex22m(1),  1mbibjoin22m(1),  1mbiblabel22m(1),  1mbiblook22m(1),  1mbibor-0m
       1mder22m(1), 1mbibsort22m(1), 1mcitefind22m(1), and 1mcitetags22m(1), to process the  text,
       and also is the one expected by the GNU Emacs BibTeX support functions.

1mOPTIONS0m
       Command-line  switches  may  be abbreviated to a unique leading prefix,
       and letter case is 4mnot24m significant.  All options are parsed before  any
       input  bibliography  files  are read, no matter what their order on the
       command line.  Options that correspond to a yes/no setting  of  a  flag
       have  a  form  with a prefix "no-" to set the flag to 4mno24m.  For such op-
       tions, the last setting determines the flag value used.  That  is  sig-
       nificant  when  options are also specified in initialization files (see
       the 1mINITIALIZATION FILES 22mmanual section).

       The leading hyphen that distinguishes an option from a filename may  be
       doubled,  for compatibility with GNU and POSIX conventions.  Thus, 1m-au-0m
       1mthor 22mand 1m--author 22mare equivalent.

       To avoid confusion with options, if a filename begins with a hyphen, it
       must  be  disguised  by  a leading absolute or relative directory path,
       e.g., 4m/tmp/-foo.bib24m or 4m./-foo.bib24m.

       1m-author                     22mDisplay an author credit  on  the  standard
                                   error unit, 4mstderr24m, and then terminate with
                                   a success return code.  Sometimes  an  exe-
                                   cutable program is separated from its docu-
                                   mentation and source code; this option pro-
                                   vides a way to recover from that.

       1m-copyleft                   22mDisplay  copyright information on the stan-
                                   dard error unit, 4mstderr24m, and then terminate
                                   with a success return code.

       1m-copyright                  22mDisplay  copyright information on the stan-
                                   dard error unit, 4mstderr24m, and then terminate
                                   with a success return code.

       1m-error-log 4m22mfilename24m         Redirect  4mstderr24m  to  the  indicated  file,
                                   which then contains all of  the  error  and
                                   warning  messages.  This option is provided
                                   for  those  systems  that  have  difficulty
                                   redirecting 4mstderr24m.

       1m-help 22mor 1m-?                 22mDisplay  a help message on 4mstderr24m, giving a
                                   usage description, similar to this  section
                                   of  the  manual  pages,  and then terminate
                                   with a success return code.

       1m-ISBN-file 4m22mfilename24m         Provide an explicit ISBN-range  initializa-
                                   tion  file.  It is processed 4mafter24m any sys-
                                   tem-wide and job-wide  ISBN  initialization

                                   1mSYS$SYSTEM22m) and 1mBIBINPUTS 22msearch paths, re-
                                   spectively,  and  may  override  them.  The
                                   ISBN  initialization  file  name   can   be
                                   changed  at  compile  time,  or at run time
                                   through a setting of the environment  vari-

       1m-init-file 4m22mfilename24m         Provide an explicit value pattern  initial-
                                   ization  file.   It  is processed 4mafter24m any
                                   system-wide  and  job-wide   initialization
                                   files  found  on  the  1mPATH  22m(for  VAX VMS,
                                   1mSYS$SYSTEM22m) and 1mBIBINPUTS 22msearch paths, re-
                                   spectively,  and  may override them.  It in
                                   turn may  be  overridden  by  a  subsequent
                                   file-specific   initialization  file.   The
                                   initialization file name can be changed  at
                                   compile time, or at run time through a set-
                                   ting  of  the  environment  variable   1mBIB-0m

                                   UNIX, and to 4mbibclean.ini24m  elsewhere.   For
                                   further  details,  see  the  1mINITIALIZATION0m

       1m-keyword-file 4m22mfilename24m      Provide an explicit keyword  initialization
                                   file.   It  is  processed 4mafter24m any system-
                                   wide and  job-wide  keyword  initialization
                                   files  found  on  the  1mPATH  22m(for  VAX VMS,
                                   1mSYS$SYSTEM22m) and 1mBIBINPUTS 22msearch paths, re-
                                   spectively,  and  may  override  them.  The
                                   keyword initialization  file  name  can  be
                                   changed  at  compile  time,  or at run time
                                   through a setting of the environment  vari-
                                   able  1mBIBCLEANKEY22m,  but  defaults  to 4m.bib-0m
                                   4mclean.key24m on UNIX, and  4mbibclean.key24m  else-
                                   where.   For  further details, see the 1mKEY-0m
                                   1mWORD INITIALIZATION FILES 22mmanual section.

       1m-max-width 4m22mnnn24m              1mbibclean 22mnormally limits output line widths
                                   to  72  characters, and in the interests of
                                   consistency,  that  value  should  not   be
                                   changed.  Occasionally, special-purpose ap-
                                   plications may  require  different  maximum
                                   line  widths,  so this option provides that
                                   capability.  The number following  the  op-
                                   tion  name can be specified in decimal, oc-
                                   tal  (starting  with  0),  or   hexadecimal
                                   (starting  with  0x).   A  zero or negative
                                   value is interpreted to mean unlimited,  so
                                   1m-max-width  4m22m024m  can  be  used to ensure that
                                   each field/value pair appears on  a  single
                                   line.

                                   When  1m-no-prettyprint  22mrequests 1mbibclean 22mto
                                   act as a lexical analyzer, the default line
                                   width  is  unlimited,  unless overridden by
                                   this option.

                                   When 1mbibclean 22mis prettyprinting, line wrap-
                                   ping is done only at a space. Consequently,
                                   a long non-blank character sequence may re-
                                   sult  in the output exceeding the requested
                                   line width.

                                   When 1mbibclean 22mis lexing, line  wrapping  is
                                   done  by inserting a backslash-newline pair
                                   when the specified maximum is  reached,  so
                                   no line length ever exceeds the maximum.

       1m-[no-]align-equals          22mWith  the  positive  form, align the equals
                                   sign in key/value assignments at  the  same
                                   column,  separated  by  a single space from
                                   the value string.   Otherwise,  the  equals
                                   sign follows the key, separated by a single
                                   space.  Default: 4mno24m.

       1m-[no-]brace-protect         22mProtect uppercase and  mixedcase  words  at
                                   brace-level  zero  with  braces  to prevent
                                   downcasing by some BibTeX styles.  Default:
                                   4myes24m.

       1m-[no-]check-values          22mWith  the  positive  form,  apply heuristic
                                   pattern matching to field values  in  order
                                   to  detect  possible errors (e.g., ``4myear24m 4m=0m
                                   4m"192"24m'' instead of ``4myear24m 4m=24m 4m"1992"24m''),  and
                                   issue warnings when unexpected patterns are
                                   found.

                                   That checking is usually beneficial, but if
                                   it  produces  too many bogus warnings for a
                                   particular bibliography file, you can  dis-
                                   able  it with the negative form of this op-
                                   tion.  Default: 4myes24m.

       1m-[no-]debug-match-failures  22mWith the positive form, print out a warning
                                   when a value pattern fails to match a value

                                   but  because  the output can be voluminous,
                                   you should use this option only with  small
                                   test  files,  and initialization files that
                                   eliminate all patterns apart from the  ones
                                   that you are testing.  Default: 4mno24m.

                                   In  journals  in the humanities and history
                                   of science, as well as in  some  scientific
                                   journals  until well into the 20th Century,
                                   academic, honorary, and professional titles
                                   and  degrees  are commonly attached to per-
                                   sonal names.  Even though modern publishing
                                   practice avoids such decorations, for accu-
                                   racy, bibliography entries  should  prefer-
                                   ably  retain  them.   Journal typographical
                                   practice generally follows  the  reductions
                                   described here.

       1m-[no-]fix-font-changes      22mWith  the  positive  form,  supply an addi-
                                   tional brace level around font  changes  in
                                   titles  to  protect  against  downcasing by
                                   some BibTeX styles.  Font changes that  al-
                                   ready  have  more  than one level of braces
                                   are not modified.

                                   For example, if a title contains the  Latin
                                   phrase  4m{\em24m  4mDictyostelium24m  4mdiscoideum}24m or
                                   4m{\em24m  4m{D}ictyostelium24m   4mdiscoideum}24m,   then
                                   downcasing  incorrectly converts the phrase
                                   to lower-case letters.  Most  BibTeX  users
                                   are surprised that bracing the initial let-
                                   ters does not prevent the downcase  action.
                                   The  correct  coding is 4m{{\em24m 4mDictyostelium0m
                                   4mdiscoideum}}24m.  However, there are also  le-
                                   gitimate  cases  where  an  extra  level of
                                   bracing wrongly protects  from  downcasing.
                                   Consequently,  1mbibclean  22mnormally  does 4mnot0m
                                   supply an extra level of braces, but if you
                                   have  a bibliography where the extra braces
                                   are routinely missing, you can use this op-
                                   tion to supply them.

                                   If  you think that you need this option, it
                                   is 4mstrongly24m recommended that you apply 1mbib-0m
                                   1mclean  22mto  your  bibliography file with and
                                   without 1m-fix-font-changes22m, then compare the
                                   two  output  files  to  ensure  that  extra
                                   braces are not  being  supplied  in  titles
                                   where they should not be present.  You must
                                   decide which of the two output files is the
                                   better  choice,  then  repair the incorrect
                                   title bracing by hand.

                                   Because font changes in titles  are  uncom-
                                   mon, except for cases of the type that this
                                   option is designed to correct, it should do
                                   more good than harm.  Default: 4mno24m.

       1m-[no-]fix-initials          22mWith  the positive form, insert a space af-
                                   ter a  period  following  author  initials.
                                   Default: 4myes24m.

       1m-[no-]fix-math              22mWith the positive form, improve readability
                                   of math mode in titles by inserting  spaces
                                   around  operators,  deleting other unneces-
                                   sary space, and removing braces around sin-
                                   gle-character  subscripts and superscripts.
                                   Default: 4mno24m.

       1m-[no-]fix-names             22mWith the positive form, reorder 4mauthor24m  and
                                   4meditor24m name lists to remove commas at brace
                                   level zero, placing first names or initials
                                   before last names.  Default: 4myes24m.

       1m-[no-]German-style          22mWith  the  positive  form,  interpret quote
                                   characters ["] inside 4mbraced24m value  strings
                                   at  brace  level 1 according to the conven-
                                   tions of the  TeX  style  file  4mgerman.sty24m,
                                   which overloads quote to simplify input and
                                   representation of  German  umlaut  accents,
                                   sharp-s  (es-zet), ligature separators, in-
                                   visible  hyphens,  raised/lowered   quotes,
                                   French  guillemets,  and  discretionary hy-
                                   phens.  Recognized  character  combinations
                                   are  braced  to  prevent BibTeX from inter-
                                   preting the quote as a string delimiter.

                                   Quoted strings receive no special  handling
                                   from  this option, and because German nouns
                                   in titles must anyway be protected from the
                                   downcasing  operation of most BibTeX bibli-
                                   ography styles, German value  strings  that
                                   use  the overloaded quote character can al-
                                   ways be entered in the form "{...}",  with-
                                   out the need to specify this option at all.

                                   Default: 4mno24m.

       1m-[no-]keep-linebreaks       22mNormally,  line breaks inside value strings
                                   are collapsed into a single space, so  that
                                   long  value  strings can later be broken to
                                   provide lines of reasonable length.

                                   With the positive form, linebreaks are pre-
                                   served  in value strings.  If 1m-max-width 22mis
                                   set to zero, this  preserves  the  original
                                   line breaks.  Spacing 4moutside24m value strings
                                   remains under 1mbibclean22m's  control,  and  is
                                   not affected by this option.

                                   Default: 4mno24m.

       1m-[no-]keep-parbreaks        22mWith  the positive form, preserve paragraph

                                   mally, paragraph breaks are collapsed  into
                                   a  single  space.   Spacing  4moutside24m  value
                                   strings remains under  1mbibclean22m's  control,
                                   and  is  not  affected by this option.  De-

       1m-[no-]keep-preamble-spaces  22mWith the positive form, preserve all white-

                                   4mno24m.

       1m-[no-]keep-spaces           22mWith the positive form, preserve all spaces
                                   in  value strings.  Normally, multiple spa-
                                   ces are  collapsed  into  a  single  space.
                                   This  option  can  be  used  together  with
                                   1m-keep-linebreaks22m,   1m-keep-parbreaks22m,    and
                                   1m-max-width  4m22m024m to preserve the form of value
                                   strings while still  providing  syntax  and
                                   value   checking.   Spacing  4moutside24m  value
                                   strings remains under  1mbibclean22m's  control,
                                   and  is  not  affected by this option.  De-

       1m-[no-]keep-string-spaces    22mWith the positive form, preserve all white-

                                   4mno24m.

       1m-[no-]parbreaks             22mWith the negative form, a  paragraph  break
                                   (either  a  formfeed,  or a line containing
                                   only spaces)  is  not  permitted  in  value
                                   strings,   or  between  field/value  pairs.
                                   That may be useful to quickly trap  runaway
                                   strings arising from mismatched delimiters.
                                   Default: 4myes24m.

       1m-[no-]prettyprint           22mNormally, 1mbibclean 22mfunctions as  a  pretty-

                                   of this option, it acts as a  lexical  ana-
                                   lyzer  instead, producing a stream of lexi-

                                   This option is for bibliographies generated
                                   with the help of the GNU Emacs BibTeX edit-

                                   of  who compiled the program, the host name
                                   on which it was compiled, the time of  com-
                                   pilation,  and  the  type  of  string-value
                                   matching code selected, when that  informa-
                                   tion is available to the compiler.

1mERROR RECOVERY AND WARNINGS0m
       When  1mbibclean  22mdetects  an  error,  it issues an error message to both
       4mstderr24m and 4mstdout24m.  That way, the user is  clearly  notified,  and  the
       output bibliography also contains the message at the point of error.

       Error  messages begin with a distinctive pair of queries, ??, beginning
       in column 1, followed by the input file name and line number.   If  the
       1m-file-position  22moption  was  specified, they also contain the input and
       output positions of the current file, entry, and value.  Each  position
       includes  the file byte number, the line number, and the column number.
       In the event of a runaway string argument, the entry  and  value  posi-
       tions  should  precisely pinpoint the erroneous bibliography entry, and
       the file positions indicate where it was detected, which may be  rather
       later in the files.

       Warning  messages  identify  possible  problems, and are therefore sent
       only to 4mstderr24m, and not to 4mstdout24m, so they never appear in  the  output
       file.   They  are identified by a distinctive pair of percents, %%, be-
       ginning in column 1, and as with error messages,  may  be  followed  by
       file position messages if the 1m-file-position 22moption was specified.

       For  convenience, the first line of each error and warning message sent
       to 4mstderr24m is formatted according to the expectations of the  GNU  Emacs
       4mnext-error24m  command.   You  can invoke 1mbibclean 22mwith the Emacs 4mM-x24m 4mcom-0m
       4mpile<RET>bibclean24m 4mfilename.bib24m  4m>filename.new24m  command,  then  use  the
       4mnext-error24m  command,  normally bound to 4mC-x24m 4m`24m (that's a grave, or back,
       accent), to move to the location of the error in the input file.

       If error messages are ignored, and  left  in  the  output  bibliography
       file,  they  precipitates  an  error when the bibliography is next pro-
       cessed with BibTeX.

       After issuing an error message, 1mbibclean 22mthen resynchronizes its  input
       by copying it verbatim to 4mstdout24m until a new bibliography entry is rec-
       ognized on a line in which the first non-blank character is an  at-sign
       (@).   That ensures that nothing is lost from the input file(s), allow-
       ing corrections to be made in either the input  or  the  output  files.
       However,  if 1mbibclean 22mdetects an internal error in its data structures,
       it terminates abruptly without further input or output processing; that
       kind  of  error  should  never happen, and if it does, it should be re-
       ported immediately to the author of the program.  Errors in initializa-
       tion  files, and running out of dynamic memory, also immediately termi-
       nate 1mbibclean22m.

1mSEARCH PATHS0m
       Versions of 1mbibclean 22mbefore 3.00 found  some  of  their  initialization
       files  in  the  same  directory as the executable program.  That design
       choice means that those files can be copied anywhere in the  file  sys-
       tem, and still be found at run time.  Some software distributions, how-
       ever, prefer to follow the model where initialization and other related
       files  are  instead stored in a directory whose name is related to that
       of the executable by a conventional difference in filepath.  For  exam-
       ple,  a program might be installed in 4m/opt/bin24m and its associated files
       in   4m/opt/share/lib/PROGRAMNAME/24m   or   4m/opt/share/lib/PROGRAMNAME/PRO-0m
       4mGRAMVERSION/24m.  The second form is preferable, because it permits multi-
       ple versions of the same program to be installed, as long as  the  exe-
       cutable  program  names carry a version suffix. Thus, a site might have
       installed programs named 4mbibclean-1.0024m,  4mbibclean-2.0024m,  4mbibclean-2.1524m,
       and  4mbibclean-3.0024m, with the versionless name 4mbibclean24m being a symbolic
       link to whichever version is the desired local default.

       With most software packages, the absolute path to  the  directory  con-
       taining associated files is compiled into the program, making it impos-
       sible to change the installation locations after the program  has  been
       built from source code.

       Some packages, however, instead use the location of the executable pro-
       gram to find files by relative path at runtime.  In the above  example,
       the  program  would  determine  its filesystem location at runtime, say
       4m/opt/bin24m, then find its associated files relative to that  location  in
       4m../share/lib/PROGRAMNAME/PROGRAMVERSION/24m.

       From  version 3.00, 4mbibclean24m uses that second approach, with an associ-
       ated directory like 4m../share/lib/bibclean/3.0024m.  That allows an instal-
       lation  directory tree to be distributed to other systems and unbundled
       4manywhere24m in the file system, as long as  the  relative  paths  are  not
       changed.   4mbibclean24m tests whether its compiled-in library path is a di-
       rectory on the local system, and if so, uses  it.   Otherwise,  it  re-
       places  that  path  by a reconstructed one based on the location of the
       executable program.  If the reconstructed path for the  library  direc-
       tory  does  not exist, it uses a warning.  In either case, it continues
       normally.

       With the old approach, initialization files on Unix systems were  named
       with  a  leading period, making them `hidden' files for the 4mls24m command.
       With the new practice, initialization files are no longer named as hid-
       den files.

1mINITIALIZATION FILES0m
       1mbibclean  22mcan  be compiled with one of three different types of pattern
       matching; the choice is made by the installer at compile time:

              o  The original version uses explicit hand-coded tests of value-
                 string syntax.

              o  The  second  version uses regular-expression pattern-matching
                 host library routines together with  regular-expression  pat-
                 terns that come entirely from initialization files.

              o  The  third  version  uses special patterns that come entirely
                 from initialization files.

       The second and third versions are the ones of most interest  here,  be-
       cause they allow the user to control what values are considered accept-
       able.  However, command-line options can also be specified in  initial-
       ization files, no matter which pattern matching choice was selected.

       When 1mbibclean 22mstarts, it searches for initialization files, finding the
       first one in the system executable program search path (on UNIX and IBM
       PC  DOS, 1mPATH22m) and the first one in the 1mBIBINPUTS 22msearch path, and pro-
       cesses them in turn.  Then, when command-line arguments are  processed,
       any  additional files specified by 1m-init-file 4m22mfilename24m options are also
       processed.  Finally, immediately before each 4mnamed24m bibliography file is
       processed,  an  attempt  is made to process an initialization file with
       the same name, but with the extension changed to 4m.ini24m.  The default ex-
       tension  can  be  changed by a setting of the environment variable 1mBIB-0m
       1mCLEANEXT22m.  That scheme permits  system-wide,  user-wide,  session-wide,
       and file-specific initialization files to be supported.

       When  input  is taken from 4mstdin24m, there is no file-specific initializa-
       tion.

       For precise control, the 1m-no-read-init-files 22moption suppresses all ini-
       tialization  files except those explicitly named by 1m-init-file 4m22mfilename0m
       options, either on the command line,  or  in  requested  initialization
       files.

       Recursive  execution of initialization files with nested 1m-init-file 22mop-
       tions is permitted; if the recursion is circular, 1mbibclean 22mfinally gets
       a  non-fatal  initialization  file  open failure after opening too many
       files.  That terminates further initialization file processing.  As the
       recursion  unwinds,  the  files are all closed, then execution proceeds
       normally.

       An initialization file may contain empty lines, comments  from  percent
       to  end  of line (just like TeX), option switches, and field/pattern or
       field/pattern/message assignments.  Leading and trailing spaces are ig-
       nored.  That is best illustrated by a short example:

       % This is a small bibclean initialization file

       -init-file /u/math/bib/.bibcleanrc  %% departmental patterns

       chapter = "\"D\""                 %% 23

       pages   = "\"D--D\""              %% 23--27

       volume  = "\"D \\an\\d D\""       %% 11 and 12

       year    = \
          "\"dddd, dddd, dddd\"" \
          "Multiple years specified."      %% 1989, 1990, 1991

       -no-fix-names   %% do not modify author/editor lists

       Long  logical lines can be split into multiple physical lines by break-
       ing at a backslash-newline pair; the  backslash-newline  pair  is  dis-
       carded.   That  processing happens while characters are being read, be-
       fore any further interpretation of the input stream.

       Each logical line must contain a complete option  (and  its  value,  if
       any),  or  a  complete  field/pattern  pair, or a field/pattern/message
       triple.

       Comments are stripped during the parsing of  the  field,  pattern,  and
       message  values.   The  comment  start  symbol is not recognized inside
       quoted strings, so it can be freely used in such strings.

       Comments on logical lines that were input as  multiple  physical  lines
       via  the  backslash-newline convention must appear on the 4mlast24m physical
       line; otherwise, the remaining physical lines become part of  the  com-
       ment.

       Pattern  strings  must  be  enclosed  in  quotation  marks; within such
       strings, a backslash starts an escape mechanism that is  commonly  used
       in UNIX software.  The recognized escape sequences are:

              1m\a     22malarm bell (octal 007)

              1m\b     22mbackspace (octal 010)

              1m\f     22mformfeed (octal 014)

              1m\n     22mnewline (octal 012)

              1m\r     22mcarriage return (octal 015)

              1m\t     22mhorizontal tab (octal 011)

              1m\v     22mvertical tab (octal 013)

              1m\ooo   22mcharacter number octal 4mooo24m (e.g 1m\012 22mis linefeed).  Up to
                     3 octal digits may be used.

              1m\0xhh  22mcharacter number hexadecimal 4mhh24m  (e.g.,  1m\0x0a  22mis  line-
                     feed).   4mxhh24m may be in either letter case.  Any number of
                     hexadecimal digits may be used.

       Backslash followed by any other character produces just that character.
       Thus, \% gets a literal percent into a string (preventing its interpre-
       tation as a comment), \" produces a quotation mark, and \\  produces  a
       single backslash.

       An ASCII NUL 4m(\0)24m in a string terminates it; that is a feature of the C
       programming language in which 1mbibclean 22mis implemented.

       Field/pattern pairs can be separated by arbitrary  space,  and  option-
       ally, either an equals sign or colon functioning as an assignment oper-
       ator.  Thus, the following are equivalent:

       pages="\"D--D\""
       pages:"\"D--D\""
       pages "\"D--D\""
         pages = "\"D--D\""
         pages : "\"D--D\""
       pages   "\"D--D\""

       Each field name can have an arbitrary  number  of  patterns  associated
       with  it; however, they must be specified in separate field/pattern as-
       signments.

       An empty pattern string  causes  previously-loaded  patterns  for  that
       field  name  to  be  forgotten.  That feature permits an initialization
       file to completely discard patterns from earlier initialization files.

       Patterns for value strings are represented in  a  tiny  special-purpose
       language  that  is both convenient and suitable for bibliography value-
       string syntax checking.  While not as powerful as the language of regu-
       lar-expression  patterns,  its  parsing  can be portably implemented in
       less than 3% of the code in  a  widely-used  regular-expression  parser
       (the GNU 1mregexp 22mpackage).

       The patterns are represented by the following special characters:

              1m<space>  22mone or more spaces

              1ma        22mexactly one letter

              1mA        22mone or more letters

              1md        22mexactly one digit

              1mD        22mone or more digits

              1mr        22mexactly one Roman numeral

              1mR        22mone or more Roman numerals (i.e. a Roman number)

              1mw        22mexactly one word (one or more letters and digits)

              1mW        22mone or more space-separated words, beginning and ending
                       with a word

              1m.        22mone  `special'  character,  one   of   the   characters
                       <space>!#()*+,-./:;?[]~,  a subset of punctuation char-
                       acters that are typically used in string values

              1m:        22mone or more `special' characters

              1mX        22mone or more `special'-separated  words,  beginning  and
                       ending with a word

              1m\x       22mexactly  one  x  (x is any character), possibly with an
                       escape sequence interpretation given earlier

              1mx        22mexactly the character x (x is anything but one of these
                       pattern characters: aAdDrRwW.:<space>\)

       The  1mX  22mpattern  character is very powerful, but generally inadvisable,
       because it matches almost anything likely to be found in a BibTeX value
       string.  The reason for providing pattern matching on the value strings
       is to uncover possible errors, not mask them.

       There is no provision for specifying ranges or repetitions  of  charac-
       ters,  but  that  can  usually be done with separate patterns.  It is a
       good idea to accompany the pattern with a comment showing the  kind  of
       thing  it is expected to match.  Here is a portion of an initialization
       file giving a few of the patterns used to match 4mnumber24m value strings:

       number  =       "\"D\""         %% 23
       number  =       "\"A AD\""      %% PN LPS5001
       number  =       "\"A D(D)\""    %% RJ 34(49)
       number  =       "\"A D\""       %% XNSS 288811
       number  =       "\"A D\\.D\""   %% Version 3.20
       number  =       "\"A-A-D-D\""   %% UMIAC-TR-89-11
       number  =       "\"A-A-D\""     %% CS-TR-2189
       number  =       "\"A-A-D\\.D\"" %% CS-TR-21.7

       For a bibliography that contains only 4marticle24m entries, that list should
       probably  be  reduced to just the first pattern, so that anything other
       than a digit string fails the pattern-match test.  That is easily  done
       by  keeping bibliography-specific patterns in a corresponding file with
       extension 4m.ini24m, because that file is read automatically.

       You should be sure to use empty pattern strings in the pattern file  to
       discard patterns from earlier initialization files.

       The  value  strings  passed  to the pattern matcher contain surrounding
       quotes, so the patterns should also.  However, you could use a  pattern
       specification  like  "\"D" to match an initial digit string followed by
       anything else; the omission of the final quotation mark \" in the  pat-
       tern allows the match to succeed without checking that the next charac-
       ter in the value string is a quotation mark.

       Because the value strings are intended to be processed by TeX, the pat-
       tern  matching ignores braces, and TeX control sequences, together with
       any space following those control sequences.  Spaces around braces  are
       preserved.  That convention allows the pattern fragment 4mA-AD-D24m to match
       the value string 4mTN-K\slash24m 4m27-7024m, because the value is implicitly col-
       lapsed to 4mTN-K27-7024m during the matching operation.

       1mbibclean22m's  normal action when a string value fails to match any of the
       corresponding patterns is to issue a  4mwarning24m  message  something  like
       this:  4m"Unexpected24m  4mvalue24m  4min24m 4m``year24m 4m=24m 4m"192"''24m.  In most cases, that is
       sufficient to alert the user to a problem.  In some cases, however,  it
       may  be  desirable  to  associate a different message with a particular
       pattern.  That can be done by supplying a message string following  the
       pattern  string.  Format items 4m%%24m (single percent), 4m%e24m (entry name), 4m%f0m
       (field name), 4m%k24m (citation key), and 4m%v24m (string value) are available to
       get current values expanded in the messages.  Here is an example:

       chapter = "\"D:D\"" "Colon found in ``%f = %v''" %% 23:2

       To  be  consistent  with other messages output by 1mbibclean22m, the message
       string should 4mnot24m end with punctuation.

       If you wish to make the message an error, rather than just  a  warning,
       begin it with a query (?), like this:

       chapter = "\"D:D\"" "?Colon found in ``%f = %v''" %% 23:2

       The query is be included in the output message.

       Escape  sequences are supported in message strings, just as they are in
       pattern strings.  You can use that to advantage for fancy things,  such
       as  terminal display mode control.  If you rewrite the previous example
       as

       chapter = "\"D:D\"" \
                 "?\033[7mColon found in ``%f = %v''\033[0m" %% 23:2

       the error message appears in inverse video on display screens that sup-
       port  ANSI  terminal  control sequences.  Such practice is not normally
       recommended, because it may have undesirable effects on some output de-
       vices.   Nevertheless,  you  may find it useful for restricted applica-
       tions.

       For some types of bibliography fields, 1mbibclean  22mcontains  special-pur-
       pose code to supplement or replace the pattern matching:

              o  4mCODEN24m,  4mISBN24m  and  4mISSN24m field values are handled that way be-
                 cause their validation requires evaluation of checksums  that
                 cannot  be expressed by simple patterns; no patterns are even
                 used in these three cases.

              o  When 1mbibclean 22mis compiled with pattern-matching code support,
                 4mchapter24m, 4mnumber24m, 4mpages24m, and 4mvolume24m values are checked only by
                 pattern matching.

              o  4mmonth24m values are first checked against  the  standard  BibTeX
                 month  abbreviations,  and only if no match is found are pat-
                 terns then used.

              o  4myear24m values are first checked against patterns,  then  if  no
                 match  is  found, the year numbers are found and converted to
                 integer values for testing against reasonable bounds.

       Values for other fields are checked only  against  patterns.   You  can
       provide  patterns  for  4many24m field you like, even ones 1mbibclean 22mdoes not
       already know about.  New ones are simply added  to  an  internal  table
       that is searched for each string to be validated.

       The  special field, 4mkey24m, represents the bibliographic citation key.  It
       can be given patterns, like any other field.  Here is an initialization
       file  pattern  assignment that matches an author name, a colon, a four-
       digit year, a colon, and an alphabetic string, in  the  BibNet  Project
       style:

       key = "A:dddd:A"                     %% Knuth:1986:TB

       Notice that no quotation marks are included in the pattern, because the
       citation keys are not quoted.  You can use such patterns  to  help  en-
       force  uniform  naming conventions for citation keys, which is increas-
       ingly important as your bibliography data base grows.

1mISBN INITIALIZATION FILES0m
       1mbibclean 22mcontains a compiled-in table of ISBN ranges  and  country/lan-
       guage settings that is suitable for most applications.

       However,  ISBN data change yearly, as new countries adopt ISBNs, and as
       publishers are granted new, or additional, ISBN prefixes.

       Thus, from version 2.12, 1mbibclean 22msupports  reading  of  run-time  ISBN
       initialization  files  found  on the 1mPATH 22m(for VAX VMS, 1mSYS$SYSTEM22m) and
       1mBIBINPUTS 22msearch paths, and then any specified by  1m-ISBN-file  4m22mfilename0m
       options.

       That  feature  makes  it  possible to incorporate new ISBN data without
       having to produce a new 1mbibclean 22mrelease and reinstall the software  at
       end-user sites.

       The  format  of  an  ISBN initialization file is similar to that of the
       1mbibclean 22minitialization files described in the preceding section:  com-
       ments  begin  with percent and continue to end of line, blank and empty
       lines are ignored, backslash-newline joins adjacent lines,  and  other-
       wise,  lines  are  expected  to  contain  a required pair of ISBN coun-
       try/language-publisher prefixes forming a non-decreasing range, option-
       ally  followed  by  one  or  more words of text that are treated as the
       country/language group value.  The latter value plays no part  in  ISBN
       validation,  but its presence is strongly recommended, in order to make
       the ISBN table more understandable for humans.

       Here is a short example:
              %% The Faeroes got ISBN assignments between 1993 and 1998
              99918-0         99918-3        Faeroes
              99918-40        99918-61
              99918-900       99918-938
       It is not necessary to repeat the country names on  succeeding  entries
       with  the  same initial number (99918 in that example); that is handled
       internally.

       Data from ISBN files normally augment the compiled-in  data.   However,
       if  the  first  prefix  begins with a hyphen, then 1mbibclean 22mdeletes the
       first entry in the table matching that first prefix (ignoring the lead-
       ing hyphen):
              %% Latvia got ISBN ranges between 1993 and 1998
              %% so we remove the old placeholder, then add the
              %% new ranges.
              -9984-0         9984-9         This one is no longer valid

              9984-00         9984-20        Latvia
              9984-500        9984-770
              9984-9000       9984-9984

1mKEYWORD INITIALIZATION FILES0m
       1mbibclean 22mcontains a compiled-in table of keyword mappings that is suit-
       able for most applications.  The default settings merely adjust letter-
       case  in certain keyword names, so that, for example, 4misbn24m is output as
       4mISBN24m.

       From version 2.12, 1mbibclean 22msupports reading of run-time  keyword  ini-
       tialization  files found on the 1mPATH 22m(for VAX VMS, 1mSYS$SYSTEM22m) and 1mBIB-0m
       1mINPUTS 22msearch paths, and then any specified by  1m-keyword-file  4m22mfilename0m
       options.

       That  feature makes it possible to incorporate special spellings of new
       keywords without having to produce a new 1mbibclean 22mrelease and reinstall
       the software at end-user sites.

       The  format  of a keyword initialization file is similar to that of the
       other 1mbibclean 22minitialization files described  in  the  preceding  sec-
       tions:  comments  begin with percent and continue to end of line, blank
       and empty lines are ignored, backslash-newline  joins  adjacent  lines,
       and otherwise, lines are expected to contain a required pair of old and
       new keyword names.

       Here is a short example:
              %% We want special handling of MathReviews keywords
              mrclass         MRclass
              mrnumber        MRnumber
              mrreviewer      MRreviewer

       Data from keywords files normally augment the compiled-in  data.   How-
       ever,  if the first keyword begins with a hyphen, then 1mbibclean 22mdeletes
       the first entry in the table matching that keyword (ignoring the  lead-
       ing hyphen):
              %% Remove special handling of ISBN, ISSN, and LCCN values.
              -issn           ISSN
              -isbn           ISBN
              -lccn           LCCN
       Even  though  the  second keyword in each deletion pair is not used, it
       still must be specified.

       Notice that this feature can be used to regularize keyword  names,  but
       use  it  with  care, in order to avoid producing duplicate key names in
       output BibTeX entries:
              %% Map variations of keywords into a common name:
              keys            keywords
              keywds          keywords
              keyword         keywords
              keywrd          keywords
              keywrds         keywords
              searchkey       keywords

1mLEXICAL ANALYSIS0m
       When 1m-no-prettyprint 22mis specified, 1mbibclean 22macts as a lexical  analyzer
       instead of a prettyprinter, producing output in lines of the form

              <token-number><tab><token-name><tab>"<token-value>"

       Each  output  line  contains  a  single complete token, identified by a
       small integer number for use by a computer program, a token  type  name
       for human readers, and a string value in quotes.

       Special  characters  in  the  token  value  string are represented with
       ANSI/ISO Standard C escape sequences, so all characters other than  NUL
       are representable, and multi-line values can be represented in a single
       line.

       Here are the token numbers and token type names that can appear in  the
       output when 1m-prettyprint 22mis specified:

               0   UNKNOWN
               1   ABBREV
               2   AT
               3   COMMA
               4   COMMENT
               5   ENTRY
               6   EQUALS
               7   FIELD
               8   INCLUDE
               9   INLINE
              10   KEY
              11   LBRACE
              12   LITERAL
              13   NEWLINE
              14   PREAMBLE
              15   RBRACE
              16   SHARP
              17   SPACE
              18   STRING
              19   VALUE

       Programs  that  parse such output should also be prepared for lines be-
       ginning with the warning prefix, %%, or the error prefix, ??,  and  for
       ANSI/ISO Standard C line-number directives of the form
              # line 273 "texbook1.bib"
       that record the line number and file name of the current input file.

       If  a  1m-max-width  4m22mnnn24m  command-line  option was specified, long output
       lines are wrapped at a backslash-newline pair, and consequently,  soft-
       ware that processes the lexical token stream should be prepared to col-
       lapse such wrapped lines back into single lines.

       As an example of the use of 1m-no-prettyprint22m, the UNIX command pipeline
              1mbibclean -no-prettyprint 4m22mmylib.bib24m | \
                  1mawk 22m'$2 == "KEY" {print $3}' | \
                  1msed 22m-e 's/"//g' | \
                  1msort0m
       extracts a sorted list of all citation keys in the file 4mmylib.bib24m.

       A certain amount of processing has been done on the tokens.  In partic-
       ular, delimiters equivalent to braces have been replaced by braces, and
       braced strings have become quoted strings.

       The LITERAL token type is used for arbitrary text  that  1mbibclean  22mdoes
       not  examine  further,  such  as  the contents of a @Preamble{...} or a
       @Comment{...}.

       The UNKNOWN token type should never appear in the output stream.  It is
       used internally to initialize token type variables.

1mSCRIBE BIBLIOGRAPHY FORMAT0m
       1mbibclean22m's  support  for the Scribe bibliography format is based on the
       syntax description in the Scribe Introductory User's Manual,  3rd  Edi-
       tion,  May  1980.   Scribe  was  originally  developed by Brian Reid at
       Carnegie-Mellon University, and was marketed by Unilogic,  Ltd.,  later
       renamed to Scribe Systems, and apparently now long defunct.

       The  BibTeX  bibliography format was strongly influenced by Scribe, and
       indeed, with care, it is possible to share bibliography  files  between
       the  two systems.  Nevertheless, there are some differences, so here is
       a summary of features of the Scribe bibliography file format:

       (1)   Letter case is not significant in field names  and  entry  names,
             but case is preserved in value strings.

       (2)   In field/value pairs, the field and value may be separated by one
             of three characters: =, /, or space.  Space may  optionally  sur-
             round these separators.

       (3)   Value  delimiters  are  any of these seven pairs: { }   [ ]   ( )

       (4)   Value delimiters may not be nested, even though  with  the  first
             four  delimiter  pairs, nested balanced delimiters would be unam-
             biguous.

       (5)   Delimiters can be omitted around values that  contain  only  let-
             ters,  digits,  sharp (#), ampersand (&), period (.), and percent
             (%).

       (6)   Outside of delimited values, a literal at-sign (@) is represented
             by doubled at-signs (@@).

       (7)   Bibliography  entries begin with @name, as for BibTeX, but any of
             the seven Scribe value delimiter pairs may be  used  to  surround
             the  values  in  field/value pairs.  As in (4), nested delimiters
             are forbidden.

       (8)   Arbitrary space may separate entry names from the  following  de-
             limiters.

       (9)   @Comment is a special command whose delimited value is discarded.
             As in (4), nested delimiters are forbidden.

       (10)  The special form

             @Begin{comment}
              ...
             @End{comment}

             permits encapsulating arbitrary text containing any characters or
             delimiters,  other  than ``@End{comment}''.  Any of the seven de-
             limiter pairs may be used around the word  ``comment''  following
             the  ``@Begin'' or ``@End''; the delimiters in the two cases need
             not   be    the    same,    and    consequently,    ``@Begin{com-
             ment}''/``@End{comment}'' pairs may 4mnot24m be nested.

       (11)  The 4mkey24m field is required in each bibliography entry.

       (12)  A  backslashed  quote  in a string is assumed to be a TeX accent,
             and braced appropriately.  While such accents do not  conform  to
             Scribe  syntax, Scribe-format bibliographies have been found that
             appear to be intended for TeX processing.

       Because of that loose syntax, 1mbibclean22m's normal error detection heuris-
       tics are less effective, and consequently, Scribe mode input is not the
       default; it must be explicitly requested.

       1mBIBINPUTS     22mSearch path for 1mbibclean  22mand  BibTeX  input  files.   On
                     UNIX,  it  is  a colon-separated list of directories that
                     are searched in order from first to last.  It is  not  an
                     error for a specified directory to not exist.

                     On other operating systems, the directory names should be
                     separated by whatever character is used in system  search
                     path specifications, such as a semicolon on IBM PC DOS.

       1mPATH          22mOn  Atari TOS, IBM PC DOS, IBM PC OS/2, Microsoft NT, and
                     UNIX, search path for system executable files.  The  sys-
                     tem-wide  1mbibclean 22minitialization file is searched for in
                     that path.

       1mSYS$SYSTEM    22mOn VAX VMS, search path for system executable  files  and
